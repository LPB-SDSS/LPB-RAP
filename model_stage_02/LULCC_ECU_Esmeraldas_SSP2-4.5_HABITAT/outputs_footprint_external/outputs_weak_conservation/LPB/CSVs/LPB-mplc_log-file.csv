"* Gross forest: Based on Copernicus pixels of forest (>15 % tree coverage for a 100x100m pixel). Can contain up to all of the the LUTs 08(disturbed forest), 09(undisturbed forest), 04(agroforestry) and 05(plantations) if not noted otherwise. LUT08 and 09 may also contain parks and gardens in the landscape."
* Net forest: Initial net forest file is the as „forest“ declared land surface by national maps. The actual percentage in LPB may differ since it only recognizes LUT 08 and 09 as forest and passes those on dynamically (with subtraction and addition at the forest fringe).
