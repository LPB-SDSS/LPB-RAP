# LPB-RAP

This is the repository for the scenario tool LPB-RAP (LaForeT-PLUC-BE model (Landscape Forestry in the Tropics – PCRaster Land Use Change – Biogeographic & Economic model; in short: LPB) and its thematic expansion module RAP (Restoration Areas Potentials)). 

Model stage 01 authored by Holler et al., 2024, was published on February 2nd, 2024, in [PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297439)

LPB-RAP is based on the [PCRaster Land Use Change model (PLUC) for Mozambique](https://github.com/JudithVerstegen/PLUC_Mozambique), created in [PCRaster](http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/) Python. Results of the PLUC model are published in [Verstegen et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.compenvurbsys.2011.08.003) and [van der Hilst et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1757-1707.2011.01147.x).

## Information

This repository contains all model files and input data for the case study area Esmeraldas province, Ecuador, for three restriction scenarios depicted in Holler et al., 2024. Due to data limitation only descriptive outputs are provided following the model output structure (R-outputs, GIFs, CSVs). The original PCRaster .map format output is too large to be provided in this repository (TB volume).
